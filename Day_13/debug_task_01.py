# Given code block:
# number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))
#
# if number % 2 = 0:
#     print("This is an even number.")
# else:
#     print("This is an odd number.")

# Solution:
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

# checking equality in an 'if' clause requires double equal signs '=='
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")
